## React Utilities

React Utilities is a basic package with helpful scripts to reduce repetitive tasks when building react applications.

### Installation

Install the package globally (note: the npm package name is weasyv-utilities)

```bash
npm install -g weasyv-utilities
```

### How to use it

In your terminal use the "create-component" command, followed by the component's name:

```bash
create-component MyComponent 
```

This will create a new directory, index, and component file with some boilerplate code:

```
src/
└── components/
    └── MyComponent/
        ├── index.ts
        └── MyComponent.tsx
```
